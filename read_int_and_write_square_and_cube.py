# pseudocode:
#     create input file, add 20 ints
#     initialize 2 variables (for list of all squares and cubes) that will store a string
#     open input file and read line by line
#         store line as str in a variable
#         remove unnecessary characters
#         convert str to int
#         compute for square and store in a variable
#         compute for cube and store in a variable
#         append square to the variable containing a string
#         append cube to the other variable containing a string
#     open txt output file for squared ints
#         write the string containing all the squares
#     open txt output file for squared ints
#         write the string containing all the cubes
