# pseudocode:
#     create while loop
#         ask user whether or not to enter a statement
#         if user answers yes:
#              ask user to input a statement and store the statement to a variable
#              open a file to write the statements into:
#              append the value from the variable to the file
#         if user answers yes:
#              break while loop
